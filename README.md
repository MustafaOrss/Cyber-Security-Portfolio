üîê Professional Statement ‚Äì SOC Analyst

As a Computer Programming graduate with strong software logic and analytical thinking skills,
I am focused on building a career as a SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst in the field of cybersecurity.
I am currently strengthening my technical capabilities through sourcing information, hands-on practice, programming, and continuous improvement.

With my background in programming, I bring a systematic and detail-oriented approach to log analysis, anomaly detection, threat identification, and incident response.
I aim to gain real-world experience using tools such as Splunk (SIEM), Python, MySQL, scripting languages, and open-source security platforms.

My goal is to contribute to the effective protection of organizations against cyber threats, respond to incidents in a timely manner, 
and keep my skills up to date in the face of an ever-evolving threat landscape. Committed to best practices, teamwork, and a proactive mindset, I am determined to grow as a SOC Analyst who adds value to secure digital environments.
